* Max Cap: 300 ETH (180B WHEAT tokens available, but adjustable)
* Wallet limit: 10 ETH per wallet

Presale WHEAT Price

* 1 ETH = 900,000,000 WHEAT
* 1 WHEAT = $0.0000018

Refer to the [Tokenomics](broken-reference) page for more information

### Launch

As soon as the presale ends, there will be a 1 hour intermission in which dev will use ETH raised from the presale

* 80% of the raised ETH will go towards WHEAT/WETH Camelot-LP.
* 20% of the raised ETH goes to dev's pockets so dev will be incentivized to work. Dev drama ends here.

{% hint style="success" %}
WHEAT price will be roughly 40% above the presale price.

\
630,000,000 WHEAT will be added to Camelot-LP pool per 1 ETH\
\
This means 1 WHEAT will be around $0.0000026
{% endhint %}

100% of the initial LP will be immediately burned
